  abstract  = {We present a methodology for legacy language resource adaptation that generates domain-specific 
              sentiment lexicons organized around domain entities described with lexical information and 
              sentiment words described in the context of these entities. We explain the steps of the methodology 
              and we give a working example of our initial results. The resulting lexicons are modelled as Linked 
              Data resources by use of established formats for Linguistic Linked Data (lemon, NIF) and for linked 
              sentiment expressions (Marl), thereby contributing and linking to existing Language Resources in 
              the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud. },
