<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Today</span> happens the super moon total eclipse. I knew the full eclipse would be at 8pm at my location and I knew the moon would be in the east. I looked through my window and nothing, no moon. I then decided to go out of home looking for a place with less trees and buildings where I could see it. I walked around and suddenly stopped in the middle of the footpath. It was there, it was happening and I could see it. In the entrance of a condominium between two buildings. I stopped and spent 20 minutes there until the full eclipse and a bit after.</p>

Meanwhile many people passed. Cars, people jogging, people walking listening music on their phones. A considerable amount of people. They passed, a person stopped in the middle of the footpath, they passed. I was there facing a super moon eclipse happening just in front of me. They passed, nobody saw it.
