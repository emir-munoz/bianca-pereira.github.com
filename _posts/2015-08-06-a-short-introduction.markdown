<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>magine, just for a second, a dreamer. From those kind of dreamers that see figures on the clouds, from those who envision the next technology, from those who believe in revolutions. Now, imagine a person under the curse of perfectionism. That person who wants to improve everything, that see each minor detail as a possible risk with 0.000001% of chance to happen, that is able to criticize and review each and any small part of an idea. Very different people, no? Now, merge both in a single person... That's hard, isn't it? Well, I am Bianca. Nice to meet you =)</p>

This blog was created with the intention of being what I like to call a "mind dump". As my mind can dream more than my hands can work, it is always good to share ideas and knowledge that we acquire in this long journey called life. Here I am not planning to create a technical, personal, or any kind of blog to advertise one of my personas. The unique purpose is to share experiences and exchange opinions. I want to create a dump of my mind that can be readen and discussed.

As promised in the title this is just a short introduction of what this website is supposed to be. See you in the next post!
