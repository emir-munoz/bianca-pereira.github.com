<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> have been using Google products since 2004. Now it is time to take a break.</p>

I love applications developed by Google. I started using them many years ago, starting by Google Search Engine and after became hooked by Gmail. All applications are easy to use, have my data always available whenever I need, and the best of all 'it is free'. For who never had money to pay for anything technological, the 'free' aspect was always the decisive one.

Today things have changed. I learned that 'free' does not really means free. I mean, I am ok with receiving advertisement in a non-ostensive way. And to be honest I am not sure if I really care for the fact that some government is looking up at my data, I just hope I will never regret that. But what I do care is about 'having a choice'.

Someone may say that we do have a choice when choosing products. That there is a free market where we can decide to go with X or Z. However, stopping to think a little bit I am not quite sure about that. It is hard to think that we will change Google for a small search engine, Amazon for a smaller retailer, or Facebook for another (which one?) social network. Together with Apple and Microsoft, these companies are currently known as ['The Frightful 5'](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/technology/techs-frightful-5-will-dominate-digital-life-for-foreseeable-future.html). The reason for this name seems to be the fact that, there is no way to get away from them. Our lives are already based on their products, without real chances to move away, and any real competition not only does not affect them but fortifies them. As soon as a competitor grows, it gets acquired; which means, the more competition the less competition.

Two years ago I decided to do an [experiment of one week without Facebook and Twitter](http://biancapereira.me/blog/how-is-life-without-facebook-and-twitter/). It was interesting but not that hard since I do not use that much social media. But Google!? Knowledge is my life. Would I be able to have a functional life without having Google at all!?

'At all' seems to much for me, but I decided to see which applications I can try experimenting living without. First, let's see which applications I currently use:

- Google Search
- Google Bookmarks
- Google Chrome
- GMail
- Google Docs
- Google Sheets
- Google Slides
- Google Drive
- Google Calendar
- Google Keep
- Google Play
- Google Maps
- Youtube
- Google Translate
- Google Photos
- Google Hangouts
- Android
- Google Contacts
- Google Scholar
- Google Analytics

20 applications!?!? 

From all those the most interesting part is.. I have no clue where my Bookmarks are stored because actually there is no real "Google Bookmarks". Even so, my bookmarks and browsing history are "magically" sync with my Google account. So, talking about choice, I think we have a clear winner. I have never thought about where my bookmarks go, who sees them, what is done with them. In particular my browsing history. Sure, I DO want to know my browsing history and maybe even get some analytics from it. But no, I don't want a company tapping this info for I don't know what. I never really chose it, I just used it! Time for a change..

I will start this experiment focusing on Google Bookmarks, but I will also add Google Chrome in the cutting out list just because I have no idea of what else gets linked with Google. Let's see what Firefox has to offer. Also, time to take some decisions and choose another application to manage my bookmarks. But how to find one? Let me "Google It"... ops
